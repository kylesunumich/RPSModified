// Rules of the Game:
//
// Rock Paper Scissors: Modified is similar to a typical game of Rock Paper Scissors with a couple of twists.
// The game is a 2 player game, each with a normal score and two special scores, an Attack score and a Defense score.
// All scores start at 0. Each player will increase their score for each round won, and their Attack and Defense
// scores may increase depending on what moves are selected by each player. Both players will select a target score
// (between 0 and 10 inclusive) at the beginning of the game, and the first player to reach this score wins!
//
// There are 6 moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Hammer, Rope, and Knife
//

//
//      Hammer: If the player's Defense score is greater than or equal to the opponent's Attack score, the player wins
//              the round. If the opponent's Attack score is greater than the player's Defense score but not 2X or more,
//              the round is a draw. If the opponent's Attack score is at least 2X the opponent's Defense score, the
//              opponent wins the round.
//
//      Rope: If the player's Defense score is greater than the opponent's Defense score. If the player's Defense score
